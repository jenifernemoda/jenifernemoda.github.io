## Intro

#### *Research question: How will the Twitter behavior of Boris Johnson and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez compare and contrast?*

\ \

* The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm, which is able to predict whether a given tweet was more likely tweeted by Boris Johnson or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, while basing such algorithm on the comparison of previous tweets posted by the two politicians. Specifically, we are interested in understanding how the content of the two politicians differ both in context and in scope.

* We choose to compare these two individuals because although they are both widely-known politicians, they are reasonably different from each other in their views and thus in the topics/opinions that they share on social media. 

* As the prime minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson is heavily involved in international affairs. Although Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not the President of the United States, she has experienced a great deal of social media attention as a young congresswoman and has weighed in on international issues as well. In addition, Johnson and Ocasio-Cortez are seen by the public as more than politicians, each has become a personality and a representative of politics in their respective nations. As Twitter can be used to communicate a wide variety of things, both political and apolitical, we aim to understand how these two similar, yet very different people use the platform.
